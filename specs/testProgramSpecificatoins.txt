easy user interface
easy testcase describe  system -> arrange inputs and things that create bugs and scnarios
bind to program
bind the handler
bind to program and handler
run the test case file on the object or program or module(act)
give you feedback of the run and assertions

beautifulll terminal intergration
cross language test machine
you specify the parall the concurrncy or async behvioiur of how you gonna
execute your code
make sure that every piece of the code works correctly

each test make sure to test a single functionality





we have to states : {
    write tests for our programs
    write tests for our handlers (functions inside our program);
    write test for individual modules of softsare functions classes ,... or the hole program

}


for program scope interface its gonna be : mola testcase.json program.py
for hanlder scope interface its must be
1.improted as module
2.create object
3.create tescase file for handler
4.set the handler for that file
5.run it and see the results
6. you can have lots of handlers and lots of linked to the testcases for a single mola object in
your test.py program all you need to do is just import the shit
